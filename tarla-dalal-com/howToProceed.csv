165,2,"Put a few saffron strands in the milk. When you add saffron to warm liquid, in this case milk, it releases flavor and a beautiful yellow color."
165,3,Mix well and keep aside till you make the Anjeer Basundi. No Indian sweet is complete without the addition of a spice like saffron.
165,4,Pour the full fat milk in a deep non-stick pan. The important thing to remember here is that the milk has to be full fat. The process of making basundi includes thickening the milk over a slow flame and this will only be possible with full fat milk. This process is similar to that of Rabdi. 
165,5,Add the sugar to the milk. We are only using 2 tbsps of sugar here because this is an anjeer basundi. The dried figs we are going to use are also very sweet in nature and hence that eliminates the need to add more sugar here.
165,6,Mix well and heat both these things over a high flame. We are doing this to bring the milk to a boil. This is should take approximately 5 minutes and it is to be stirred occasionally. The quality and the thickness of the pan really matters here as you do not want the milk to burn and brown at the bottom of the pan.
165,7,"Reduce the heat to a low-medium flame and cook for 15 to 17 minutes, while stirring occasionally and while scrapping the sides of the pan. This step is essential to the Anjeer basundi recipe because the malai stuck to the pan provides the thickness and consistency we desire in the basundi."
165,8,"Once the milk is reduced by half, add the anjeer pieces. Only dried figs should be used to make the basundi as fresh figs will result in the milk curdling."
165,9,Also add saffron-milk mixture which we had kept aside previously. The milk would’ve gotten a yellow color by now.
165,10,Add the cardamom powder as well. This spice is also very important in making Indian Sweets. Even a little of the powder goes a long way in providing flavor.
165,11,"Mix well and cook on a medium flame for 2 minutes, while stirring occasionally and scrapping the sides of the pan."
165,12,Switch off the flame and cool completely.
165,13,"Refrigerate for atleast 1 hour. After making the basundi, it might seem a little runny but that will thicken as you refrigerate it."
