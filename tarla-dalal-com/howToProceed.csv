170,3,Mix well and keep aside till you make the Anjeer Basundi. No Indian sweet is complete without the addition of a spice like saffron.
170,4,Pour the full fat milk in a deep non-stick pan. The important thing to remember here is that the milk has to be full fat. The process of making basundi includes thickening the milk over a slow flame and this will only be possible with full fat milk. This process is similar to that of Rabdi. 
170,5,Add the sugar to the milk. We are only using 2 tbsps of sugar here because this is an anjeer basundi. The dried figs we are going to use are also very sweet in nature and hence that eliminates the need to add more sugar here.
170,6,Mix well and heat both these things over a high flame. We are doing this to bring the milk to a boil. This is should take approximately 5 minutes and it is to be stirred occasionally. The quality and the thickness of the pan really matters here as you do not want the milk to burn and brown at the bottom of the pan.
170,7,"Reduce the heat to a low-medium flame and cook for 15 to 17 minutes, while stirring occasionally and while scrapping the sides of the pan. This step is essential to the Anjeer basundi recipe because the malai stuck to the pan provides the thickness and consistency we desire in the basundi."
170,8,"Once the milk is reduced by half, add the anjeer pieces. Only dried figs should be used to make the basundi as fresh figs will result in the milk curdling."
170,9,Also add saffron-milk mixture which we had kept aside previously. The milk would’ve gotten a yellow color by now.
170,10,Add the cardamom powder as well. This spice is also very important in making Indian Sweets. Even a little of the powder goes a long way in providing flavor.
170,11,"Mix well and cook on a medium flame for 2 minutes, while stirring occasionally and scrapping the sides of the pan."
170,12,Switch off the flame and cool completely.
170,13,"Refrigerate for atleast 1 hour. After making the basundi, it might seem a little runny but that will thicken as you refrigerate it."

			To make Homemade Curd using Cow's milk, rinse a deep non-stick pan with 2 tbsp of water and simmer it for 2-3 minutes. This is generally done in stainless steel pans but, if you have an old non-stick pan it is advisable to make this extra effort so, that the milk does not burn. If using a stainless steel patila, you can use the same vessel to set the curd.
	

"

			Rotate the pan in a clockwise motion, so the water spreads evenly in the pan. This will prevent milk from scorching as the water forms a protective layer between the pan and milk.
	

"

			Discard the water and pour the cow's milk into the pan. We have used cow's milk here as it is the type of milk that is most used in Indian homes. It makes a creamy and delicious curd but if you want a thicker curd, it is better to use buffalo milk as it contains more fat content than cow's milk.
	

"
581,4,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Boil the milk on a medium flame for 6 to 8 minutes. Stir it occasionally to avoid the milk from sticking to the bottom of the pan or browning. Generally, for making dahi at home, you just need to warm the milk slightly. In hot climate, you will need to warm the milk very slightly but, if the weather is cold you need to warm it a little more.
	

"
581,5,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Switch off the flame and allow to cool slightly (lukewarm). Immerse your finger to check the temperature of the milk and then only add the starter. Do not putt the milk in refrigerator to cool it quickly, it has to be cooled down at room temperature.

			Add the curd in a bowl or pan. This is called as jaman or a starter which helps in setting the curd. In winters, you would require more starter to set the curd so, adjust the quantity according to the season.You can also use clay bowls, glass or ceramic bowls to set the curd.

"
581,9,"

581,13,"
	
		
	
	
		
			After setting the curd, keep it inside the refrigerator or else it can get sour taste. If you place the curd inside the refrigerator, it will get thicker and the taste will remain fresh.

2432,3,"Combine the warm milk and lemon juice in a bowl, mix well and keep aside for 10 minutes. This mixture helps in binding the batter together."
2432,4,"First of all we will combine all the dry ingredients for that, take the plain flour in a deep bowl."
2432,5,Add the cocoa powder. The chocolaty flavour is due to the addition of cocoa powder.
2432,6,Add the castor sugar. Caster sugar is nothing but finely granulated white sugar.
2432,7,Now add baking powder and add baking soda. Both baking powder and baking soda are leavening agents that cause the batter to rise making the eggless banana chocolate loaf fluffy.
2432,8,Mix well using a spoon. Keep aside.
2432,9,Take the mashed bananas in another deep bowl. Bananas make the loaf super moist & provide a rich dense flavor on baking. Ensure they are completely ripe. Use a fork to mash the bananas.

2432,12,Now add the prepared milk-lemon juice mixture and mix well using a spatula. Keep aside.
2432,13,Gradually add the plain flour-cocoa powder mixture to the banana mixture and fold it using a spatula.
2432,14,The batter is mixed and ready. It is very important to mix it using the cut and fold method. Folding traps extra air in the batter and breaks up existing air bubbles into smaller ones which results into a lighter batter.
2432,15,Add the chopped dark chocolate to make the loaf chocolatier. Make sure you have the best quality ingredients while making baked goodies.
2432,16,Add the walnuts and mix gently. They give a nice crunch to the Banana Chocolate loaf on baking.

2432,18,Spread the batter nicely using a spatula.
2432,19,Pat the tin lightly so that the batter spreads evenly.
2432,20,Sprinkle the chocolate chips evenly over it. You can also sprinkle some chopped walnuts if you like.
2432,21,"Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C (360°F) for 50 to 55 minutes. To check whether the loaf is baked properly or no, insert a toothpick or a knife into the center of the loaf. If it comes out clean then it is cooked completely.  You might have some melted chocolate chips which is fine but, don’t be fooled because of it and overbake the loaf."
2432,22,"Cool it, loosen the edges using a knife and demould it by inverting the tin over a rack and tap gently to unmould the loaf."
2432,23,Cut into thick slices and serve immediately.
2432,24,"You can even store in an air-tight container and use it later. Also, you can wrap freshly baked chocolate banana bread in a cling wrap or aluminum foil before placing it in the refrigerator and increase its shelf life to 3-4 days."

2436,1,"To make Eggless Chocolate Chip Cookies, first in a bowl take plain flour."
2436,2,"Add the baking powder.It works as a leavening agent that helps the dough to rise well. In any recipe, the amount of baking powder should be used very precisely, as excess baking powder will cause the product to collapse while less baking powder will make it heavy."
2436,3,Then add baking soda. Baking soda is also used as a leavening agent in baking. Baked recipes leavened using baking soda usually have a lighter crumb and show signs of aeration (in form of tiny holes) because of the escape of carbon dioxide.
2436,4,Mix everything together and keep aside.
2436,5,In another bowl take sugar.
2436,6,Add soft butter.
2436,7,"Then whisk well to cream the butter and sugar. When you cream the butter and sugar, it does more than simply combining the two ingredients and making it soft, you’re beating air bubbles and air pockets into it, which is needed for the baking soda and baking powder to work."
2436,8,Creamed butter and sugar is ready. Now add vanilla essence and milk.
2436,9,Then add the chocolate chips.Mix well with a spatula.
2436,10,To this add the plain flour mixture.

			To make the fresh curd recipe, rinse a deep non-stick pan with 2 tbsp of water and simmer it for 2-3 minutes. This is generally done in stainless steel pans but, if you have an old non-stick pan it is advisable to make this extra effort so, that the milk does not burn. If using a stainless steel patila, you can use the same vessel to set the curd.
	

"
2583,2,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Rotate the pan in a clockwise motion, so the water spreads evenly in the pan. This will prevent milk from scorching as the water forms a protective layer between the pan and milk. If the milk scorches, there will be tiny brown bits of burnt milk in the pan. Hence this step is necessary to avoid such a thing.
	

"
2583,3,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Discard the water and pour 1 litre of milk into the pan. Since this is a low calorie recipe, we have used low fat milk.
	

"
2583,4,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Boil the milk on a medium flame for 6 to 8 minutes. Stir it occasionally to avoid the milk from sticking to the bottom of the pan or browning. Generally, for making dahi at home, you just need to warm the milk slightly. In hot climate, you will need to warm the milk very slightly but, if the weather is cold you need to warm it a little more.
	

"

			Switch off the flame and allow to cool slightly (lukewarm). Dip your finger in the milk to check the temperature of the milk and then only add the starter. Do not think of putting the milk in refrigerator to cool it quickly. It is important to cool down the milk at room temperature only.

4261,5,Add the low-fat milk. You can even use regular milk or avoid milk altogether. But usually Gujarati khakhras do use a little bit of milk in the dough.

4261,7,Mix all the ingredients together so that the masalas are evenly distributed throughout the flour.

4261,13,Heat a non-stick tava (griddle) and place the rolled dough onto it.
4261,14,Cook the khakhra on a slow flame till pink spots appear on both the sides. The flame here has to be slow because you do not want the dough to burn.
4261,15,"Continue cooking the khakhra on a slow flame, while pressing with a folded muslin cloth or a khakhra press. The reason we press down on it is to avoid the roti from puffing up."

4264,5,With this also add the basic Indian spices. First we will add coriander-cumin seeds powder.

4264,9,"Take another broad non-stick pan and put the white sauce in it. White sauce (or béchamel) is a basic sauce used mostly in Italian and French cuisines. It is made by cooking fat (butter or oil) with flour, adding milk to it and then cooking till it is thickened."
4264,10,Also add ½ cup of cheese to this.
4264,11,"Mix well and cook on medium flame for 1 minute, while stirring occasionally or till the cheese completely melts. This will give the sauce a thick, creamy texture and a salty taste."
4264,12,"Once the cheese is incorporated completely, add the masala mixture to the sauce. This is the unique part about this dish that it has both western and Indian influences over the flavor."
4264,13,"Also add the boiled macaroni, mix well and cook on a medium flame for 2 minutes, while stirring occasionally. The macaroni has to be heated up properly, the masala has to mix well and both flavors should combine properly. You don’t need to add salt because the white sauce will already have but you still taste and adjust the seasoning."
4264,14,Pour the prepared mac and cheese into a baking dish.
4264,15,Sprinkle some fresh coriander leaves over the cheese for an Indian touch.
4264,16,Sprinkle the remaining ½ cup of cheese over it evenly. This will give an even layer of cheese on top that will become light brown and bubbly.
4264,17,Bake this in a pre-heated oven at 200°C(400°F) for 10 minutes.
4264,18,Serve hot along with a stuffed cheesy garlic bread.
4271,1,"Heat a broad non-stick pan, add the cashewnuts (kaju) and dry roast on a medium flame for 1 minute. Do keep an eye on the cashews while dry roasting as they tend to brown immediately, which isn’t very pleasing then. Remove them into a big bowl and keep aside."
4271,2,"In the same broad non-stick pan, add the almonds (badam) and dry roast on a medium flame for 1 minute. The skin of the almond is edible but sometimes bitter. Taste first, if it's not too bitter, don't bother removing it as it will add flavour to the recipe. Remove the almonds from the flame, add it to the bowl of cashewnuts and keep aside."
4271,3,"In the same broad non-stick pan, add the pistachios. Choose pistachios that have shells split open at one end. Unopened shells are an indicator of immaturity. Alternatively taste and buy shelled pistachios. Also always store pistachios in the refrigerator as they tend to turn rancid quickly. Dry roast them on a medium flame for 1 minute. Remove the pistachios from the flame, add it to the bowl of cashewnuts and almonds and keep aside."
4271,4,"In the same broad non-stick pan, add the last 2 ingredients for dry roasting i.e. whole cardamom (elaichi) with the shell and whole peppercorns (kalimirch) and dry roast them on a medium flame for 1 minute only. If you don’t have peppercorns in your pantry, you can avoid them. Remove from the flame and add it to the bowl of roasted nuts. "
4271,5,"Cool all the ingredients completely. If the nuts aren’t cooled well, then post grinding, the masala powder might tend to become lumpy and this will decrease its shelf life."
4271,6,Transfer all the ingredients from the bowl to a blender.
4271,7,"Add the sugar. Prefer to use sugar with small crystals than big crystals, just for the reason that it blends well and faster."
4271,8,"Close the lid of the blender and grind all the ingredients into a coarse powder. For grinding try and use a blade which has 3 to 4 prongs preferably. A blade with 2 prongs might not be able to break and grind the whole nuts uniformly. Also do not grind it for too much time. You need a coarse mixture. So the best idea is to start the grinder for about 10 to 15 seconds and put it off. Shake the jar once, restart the process of grinding and repeat the procedure once or twice more till you get the desired result."
4271,9,Open the lid of the grinder and transfer the coarse powder to a big bowl or jar.
4271,10,"Add the nutmeg powder and mix well. Often termed as jaiphal powder, its known for its sleep inducing properties and thus added to masala milk powder. If you don’t have nutmeg powder, you can also add a very small piece of whole nutmeg to the grinding jar at step 8."
4271,11,"Add the rich spice saffron finally and mix well. This is added not only for its pleasing flavour and taste but also for its attractive colour. While you will also have to add saffron when you make masala milk, a small amount of saffron added at this stage in the powder will blend well with other powdered nuts."

			Boil the moong dal for 5-6 minutes. This is called parboiling the dal. This way the dal is cooked but still holds its shape and is not very soft.
"
4819,3,"


			Drain the dal and keep aside to cool completely before adding it to the whole wheat flour. We have used green moong dal which is rich in protein and also aids weight loss but you can use yellow moong dal as well.
"
4819,4,"


			In a deep bowl, place the whole wheat flour.
"

"
4819,11,"

			Also add the dried mango powder. This will give a nice zing to the paratha to counter the sugar.
"
4819,13,"


			Finally add the oil and salt. Oil helps in making the paratha soft.
"
4819,14,"


			Mix all the ingredients together by hand and slowly start forming a dough.
"
4819,15,"


			Knead this mixture into a soft dough using approximately 1/4 cup water.
"
4819,16,"


			Divide the dough into 12 equal portions and shape them into balls.
"
4819,17,"


			Dip one portion of the dough in flour, shake off the excess flour and flatten it lightly on the rolling board.
"
4819,18,"


			Roll it into a 150 mm. (6”) diameter circle using a little whole wheat flour for rolling.
"
4819,19,"


			Heat a non-stick tava (griddle) and place a paratha on it.
"
4819,20,"


			Once half cooked, flip it over and grease with 1/4 tsp oil.
"
4819,21,"


			Using another ¼ tsp of oil, cook the parathas till they turn golden brown in colour from both the sides. Lightly press the sides so that they do not remain uncooked. Keep aside.
"
4819,22,"


			Repeat steps 17 to 21 to cook 11 more parathas.
"
4819,23,"


			Allow the parathas to cool completely and pack in a tiffin or serve immediately with Green chutney.

			To make the Rice Kheer recipe, wash and soak the long grained rice for 30 minutes. If you don’t wish to soak or forgot to soak the rice then alternatively you can even roast the basmati rice in 1 tsp of ghee for 2-3 minutes on a slow flame till they are golden brown in colour, release an aroma then keep it aside. Soaking/roasting makes the cooking of rice easier.

This will prevent milk from burning from the bottom as the water forms a protective layer between the pan and milk. Also, it is advisable to use a heavy bottom pan to make Indian desserts like basundi, kheer, rabdi."
6395,4,"Now, add the full-fat milk in that deep non-stick pan and bring it to a boil on a high flame. This would take around 6-8 minutes. Stir it occasionally to avoid milk from sticking to the bottom of the pan or browning. It is very important to use full-fat milk as it will provide the rice-kheer a rich and creamy texture."
6395,5,Add the drained rice and mix well.
6395,6,"Cook it on a slow flame for 35-40 minutes while stirring and scraping the sides of the pan occasionally. It is always better to stay near the stove when the milk pot is on, to avoid cleaning up later. Use a flat spoon or a whisk so, it reaches all the corners of the pan easily while scraping."
6395,7,"Meanwhile, dry roast the saffron in a saucepan on a medium flame for 30 seconds. This is done so that saffron releases it’s beautiful colour and flavour when added to the kheer."

6395,10,Cook until rice is soft and breaks easily with a spoon or on pinching with your finger. Do not add sugar before the rice has turned mushy or else your rice will take forever to cook.
6395,11,Add the sugar and mix well. You can increase the quantity of sugar if you prefer it more sweeter.
6395,12,Simmer the milk on a slow flame for 3-5 minutes while stirring and scraping the sides of the pan occasionally.

6395,16,Cook the rice kheer on a slow flame for 10-12 minutes and switch off the flame. Ensure that it is little runny in consistency as it thickens after cooling down.

			To make the roti dough, you will need a thali called parat, i.e. a stainless steel flour dough kneading plate. In this plate the flour won’t spread and fall off and also will be easy to knead the dough.
	

"
6489,2,"
	
		
	
	
		
			So let’s get started. First take the whole wheat flour, which is now easily available readymade in stores.
	

"
6489,3,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Then add 1.5 tablespoon of oil. Oil helps to bind the flour and also keeps the rotis soft.
	

"
6489,4,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Then add a pinch of salt, but it’s optional. Salt is to add flavour and taste to the roti, as many people don’t like their rotis bland.
	

"
6489,5,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Then add water, taking care to add water little by little as required or else the dough will be sticky and difficult to knead. The quantity of water depends upon the quality of flour.
	

"
6489,6,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Keep adding water as required and knead the dough. As you keep kneading the dough you will understand how much more water to add.
	

"
6489,7,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Knead and gather the dough from the sides of the parat to form a mass. Add water so that the dough is soft but not sticking to your fingers at all.
	

"
6489,8,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Check the dough for softness and add some water and oil as needed. Punch the dough with your knuckles and keep on kneading for around 2 minutes or until the dough is soft and pliable. The dough for rotis should be soft and not stiff as for puris. Also if the dough is very soft it will be sticky and you will be unable to roll. 
	

"
6489,9,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Keep the kneaded dough aside covered with a soft cloth or bowl for 15 to 20 minutes. If you wish you can make the rotis immediately, but I suggest keep the dough aside for some time as it gives a nice texture and the rotis will be softer and more fluffy.
	

"
6489,10,"
	
		
	
	
		
			The roti dough can be refrigerated for 2-3 days. The best way to refrigerate the dough is to lightly oil the dough and the bowl. The bowl you are storing the dough should be spacious and should be covered tightly to prevent it from drying.

"
6697,4,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Put the 3 1/2 cups curd in the strainer. We have used thick curd which is made with full fat milk. You can buy the curd from a store or you can learn how to make curd with full fat milk. Using thick curd gives a creamier shrikhand. Make sure to use fresh curd and not a sour one or else the shrikhand will be sour.

			Hang this dahi, preferably in a cool place, over a bowl, and let it stay that way for at least 2-3 hours. This is to remove the whey from the dahi. This whey (liquid) is what makes the curd loose and watery. Once removed, the curd will be super thick and creamy.
	

"
6697,8,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Alternately, if you do not want to hang it, put the muslin cloth with curd in a strainer over a bowl and put some weight on it to release the whey. If you are using this method, make sure there is enough distance between the strainer and the bowl so that the collected whey does not come in contact with the curd.
	

"
6697,9,"
	
		
	
	
		
			This is what the curd will look like after 3 hours. This is called Hung Curd or Chakka Dahi. If your curd is not thick, you might have to keep it hanging for longer. Some people even hang it overnight. 3 1/2 cups of thick curd resuled in approximately 2 cups of hung curd. Keep aside.

			Grease it with ½ tsp of butter. Butter for greasing is used to season the tava and form a layer that helps in easy removal of the uttapa after cooking. This initial greasing is done only once before making the uttapa.
	

"
7840,3,"

"
7840,5,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Pour ½ cup of the dosa batter on the tava. This is approximately 2 ladleful. This dosa batter has to be very thick. In case if you have purchased the dosa batter from the market and you find it isn’t thick as required, add some rice flour to it and mix it very well till no lumps remain.
	

"
7840,6,"

"
7840,7,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Let it cook for 30 seconds. This minimum cooking time is required for the utappa to cook slightly from top so that the chutney could be easily spread. A little patience at this step is a must.
	

"
7840,8,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Place 2 tsp of green chutney in the centre. You can make a spicy coriander or minty coriander chutney. This chutney should not be very thick nor very runny. It should be just enough thick to spread well. Also try and use fresh chutney for best results.
	

"
7840,9,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Place 2 tsp of red chutney over it. This is garlic and Kashmiri red chilli chutney. This gives the sandwich uttapa its red colour in the center layer.

			Pour 1/3 cup of batter over the vegetables. This is approximately 1½ ladleful This top layer has less batter as compared to the bottom layer of uttapa so that flipping the sandwich uttapa becomes easier.
	

"
7840,21,"
	
		
	
	
		
			Spread the batter evenly on top of veggies using a big spoon to make a thin even layer. While spreading the batter, it is suggested to leave 1 cm from the circumference as after turning over the batter spreads more. We would suggest to use a spoon at this stage to spread the batter as a flat ladle makes it difficult to spread the batter over the veggies.
	

"
7840,22,"
