Whole amlas simmered in a cardamom and saffron flavoured syrup is one of my personal favourites. There are several traditional recipes for making this murabba.

On the third day, the syrup is boiled again along with the flavouring to a thick honey like consistency and the amlas are added. The thick syrup helps in the preservation of the murabba and also complements the sharp and acidic amla taste.     When preserved for a long period of time, the syrup of the murabba turns to a dark brown to an almost black colour and takes in all the goodness of the amlas.
